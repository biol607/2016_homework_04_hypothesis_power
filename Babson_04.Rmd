1) W&S Chapter 6 questions 15, 21, and 29

2) W&S Chapter question 22 - use R to calculate a p-value

3) From lab, many alphas, many sds
```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
set.seed(80)

null_m <- 80
m <- 80 + 5


# create data frame with sample sizes
sim_data <- data.frame(samp_size = rep(1:20, 500))

# also look at multiple SD sizes (vector of sd values from 3 to 10, iterate by 1)
many_sds <- seq(3, 10, 1)

# crossing initial data frame of sample sizes and vector of sd values
cross_df <- sim_data %>%
  crossing(sd = many_sds)

# get a sample mean for all sample sizes and sds
cross_df <- cross_df %>%
  
  #group by 1:n() means you dont need sim numbers  #group by row, as each is 1 sim
  group_by(sims = 1:n()) %>%
  
  #get sample means
  mutate(samp_mean = mean(rnorm(samp_size, m, sd))) %>%
  
  ungroup()


###calculate results from z-tests
cross_df <- cross_df %>%
  #pop SE = sd/sqrt(samp_size)
  mutate(se_y = sd/sqrt(samp_size)) %>%
  #calculate z
  mutate(z = (samp_mean-80)/se_y) %>%
  #get p values
  mutate(p = 2*pnorm(abs(z), mean=0, sd=1, lower.tail = FALSE))


###plot p by sample size, using facet_wrap for different SD values
ggplot(cross_df, mapping = aes(x=samp_size, y=p)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4) +
  facet_wrap(~sd)


###calculate power
power_cross_df <- cross_df %>%
  #group for each sample size and sd
  group_by(samp_size, sd) %>%
  #calc type 2 error rate
  summarise(error_rate = sum(p>0.05)/n()) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  mutate(power = 1 - error_rate)

###plot power using color for different SD values. include threshold power of 0.8
ggplot(power_cross_df, mapping = aes(x=samp_size, y=power, color=factor(sd))) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.8)

###last, use crossing again to explore changing alphas from 0.01 to 0.1. 
alpha <- seq(0.01, 0.1, 0.01)

alpha_cross_df <- cross_df %>%
  crossing(alpha = alpha) %>%
  #for each samp size, sd, and alpha
  group_by(samp_size, sd, alpha) %>%
  #calctype 2 error rate
  summarise(error_rate = sum(p>alpha)/n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  #calc power
  mutate(power=1-error_rate)
  
###Plot power curves with different alphas as different colors, and use faceting to look at different SDs.

ggplot(alpha_cross_df, mapping = aes(x=samp_size, y=power, color=factor(alpha))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~sd)


##What do you learn about how alpha and SD affect power?
   # higher alpha, means higher power
   # higher SD, lower power
   # high alpha and low SD give highest power


## increasing effect size may increase power as it gets increasingly more than the standard deviation
## increasing effect size may also help to further differentiate the sample from the null distribution?
